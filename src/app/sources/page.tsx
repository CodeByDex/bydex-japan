            <p>This study app is built using my personal knowledge and experience gained over my two decades plus of studying Japanse
                However, there are reference texts I have also used and compiled together to ensure completeness and accuracy.
                You will find the details of those texts below. 
                Beyond just citing I would also recommend these texts for any learners as worth while investments for your studies.
                I receive no endorsements.
